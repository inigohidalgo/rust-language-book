# My examples from *The Rust Programming Language*

[The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) by Steve Klabnik and Carol Nichols

These are my examples from working through the book.
Some of them are copy-pasted from the book, and some include my own modifications when testing stuff.
